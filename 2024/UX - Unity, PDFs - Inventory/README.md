# UX_FPS
FPS inventory to complete my final UX assessment

## Assignment Descriptor
### Requirements (PDF)
This is to be a word document or similar containing your research notes and specifying the requirements that you have determined by conducting UX research. Your final build will be measured against these requirements and the document needs to be suitable for this purpose.
- What UX research methods did you use and why
- How did you conduct research (e.g. how many participants, under what conditions etc)?
- What did you learn about the UX requirements?
- How will you use your Requirements Document to prove that your final build meets the users' needs?
- What technology stack will you use for the final build and why?

### Prototype (Build)
You need to build a working prototype, either with code or with a prototyping tool. <br/>
This should be able to be shown to users to test all the requirements in your requirements document and to determine any adjustments needed to the UX design. <br/>
Show Requirements and Prototype to lecturer in class and explain the main features of your design. <br/>

### Testing (PDF)
Submit a document that shows that you have properly tested your prototype. In this document, include your testing notes and identify any changes that need to be made in the final build.
- How did you test your prototype and with whom?
- What UX considerations did you discover when testing?
- What changes need to be made for your final build?

### Final Build (Build and current code)
You should be building this the whole time as it will take a while to get all the details right. <br/>
In other words, get a skeleton built early on. <br/>
Your code needs to be modular, maintainable and tidy at all times. <br/>
Make sure a11y and responsiveness are built in from the start. <br/>
This last part will be making sure all your learnings from the prototype are incorporated and polishing the user workflow, ensuring no errors, meeting all 10 heuristics etc. <br/>
