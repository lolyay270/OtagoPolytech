Coding Standards:

File and Folder Structure:

Organize your project with a clear directory structure.
Separate components into their own folders.
Use lowercase for folder and file names (e.g., mycomponent.svelte).
Component Naming:

Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., MyComponent.svelte).
Make component names descriptive and indicative of their purpose.
Indentation and Formatting:

Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces).
Configure your code editor to automatically format Svelte files.
Use single quotes for attribute values (e.g., attr='value').
Whitespace:

Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.
Maintain consistent spacing around operators and braces.
Avoid trailing white spaces and empty lines at the end of files.
Comments:

Include comments to explain complex logic or unusual code.
Use clear and concise comments to describe the purpose of your components.
JavaScript:

Use JavaScript code sparingly within Svelte components.
Prefer reactive statements and Svelte's built-in features over complex JavaScript logic whenever possible.
HTML:

Follow best practices for writing HTML.
Use semantic HTML elements when appropriate (e.g., <button> for buttons).
Avoid inline styles and use classes for styling.
CSS:

Use scoped CSS within Svelte components by using the <style> tag.
Keep your CSS organized and modular.
Prefer class-based selectors over tag-based selectors.
Event Handling:

Use Svelte event handling syntax (e.g., on:click) over traditional DOM event listeners.
Keep event handlers concise and focused.
Props and Stores:

Define props with clear and descriptive names.
Avoid modifying props directly; treat them as read-only.
Use Svelte stores for managing shared state when necessary.
Conditional Rendering:

Use {#if}, {#else}, and {#each} blocks for conditional rendering and list iteration.
Avoid unnecessary nesting.
Component Lifecycle:

Understand Svelte's component lifecycle and use it appropriately.
Initialize data in the data block.
Perform side effects in onMount and clean them up in onDestroy.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling mechanisms when dealing with external data or APIs.
Use try-catch blocks when necessary.
Testing:

Write unit tests for your Svelte components.
Use testing libraries like testing-library/svelte or similar.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation for your components and their props.
Consider using tools like JSDoc for documenting JavaScript functions.
Version Control:

Use version control (e.g., Git) and follow a branching strategy.
Write meaningful commit messages.
Performance:

Optimize components for performance using Svelte's reactive system.
Profile and optimize critical parts of your application.
Accessibility (a11y):

Ensure your components are accessible by following accessibility best practices.
Use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
Internationalization (i18n):

Plan for internationalization and localization if your project may need it in the future.
Dependency Management:

Keep dependencies up-to-date.
Regularly audit and remove unused dependencies.
