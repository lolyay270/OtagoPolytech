# Purpose of This Repo
This repo is intended to keep all the work I create in my Bachelor of IT. <br/>
It is needed since all work is pushed to Polytechnic owned private repositories. <br/>
Sadly this means there is no GitHub history, except when uploaded to this repo.

# Format of File Structure
Each different project I have worked on has its own folder in the correct year. <br/>
They are in the format of: `PaperName - CodingLanguages/Programs - BreifDescription` <br/>
