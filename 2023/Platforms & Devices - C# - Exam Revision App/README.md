## New Features and Updates (Version 1.1)

We have added a new functionality to the question answering process. Now, during any question, you can go back to the main menu by inputting "m". This new feature provides more flexibility during your revision process. 

Here is how the new feature works:

1. After a question or an answer is displayed, you will see a prompt saying "Press ENTER to reveal answer, M for Main Menu" or "Press ENTER to go to next, M for Main Menu".
2. If you press the "m" key, you will be taken back to the main menu, allowing you to choose another action.
3. If you press the Enter key, you will proceed as usual.

This update is aimed at providing a better, more flexible revision experience. Happy studying!
